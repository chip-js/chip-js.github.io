Another day, another Javascript framework right? But, what if that framework was unlike any other? ChipJS, or simply, "Chip" is exactly that.

When the sports team management application, [TeamSnap](https://teamsnap.com), decided to migrate its web application and over 6 million users to a single page Javascript application, it carefully considered its options and the potential benefits / setbacks with the *then* current offering of Javascript frameworks. It was quickly realized that the framework needed to be lighter, and more nimble than what was on the table - and Chip was born.

Proven in the crucible of production, with billions of inits and gigabytes of data digested, Chip, has proven its effectiveness, and seeks to grow ever smaller... ever faster.
