After almost a year of development and *testing* under heavy production use, we are proud to present ChipJS - an ULTRA-lightweight and insanely powerful Javascript framework.

Chip may stand on the shoulders of giants, but its footing is all its own. With its dead-simple implementation and an Ã»ber-effecient approach to framing up your application - Chip is a win/win.

Since the release of Chip v1, we've been hard at work on v2 with an even faster, lighter footprint. Follow along as we create a new kind of Javascipt framework expereince... friendly - with a smile. :)
